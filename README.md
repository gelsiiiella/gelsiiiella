  <p>Hi, you can call me Gels. I'm a 20-year-old, 3rd-Year BS Computer Science student.</p>
  <p>I'm into Backend Development, Cybersecurity, and Data Science. With that said, I'm interested working on some projects related to those field, including API integration. I started my <b><i>#100DaysofCodeChallenge</i></b> last January 2024. Joining that challenge makes me more accountable on my growth as an aspiring developer.
